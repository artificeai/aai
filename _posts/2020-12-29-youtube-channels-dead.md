Our first project has been concluded due to a critical failure of one of our dependencies. We currently operate with no revenue and cannot afford to keep these projects alive with premium access to certain project features. It is possible that free-to-use dependencies exist, but we have not been able to locate them and integrating them would require costly refactoring of Project one. 

Due to these circumstances, Project One will cease all operations effective immediately.

At some point, we would like to make the source code of Project One publically available, however, the date for making it public is TBD.

All our channels will remain public until further notice and can be found here:
