Artifice AI is a group for machine learning research. The members of the group are all employed full-time, but allocate some of their free time to working on interesting projects in machine learning and other state-of-the-art technologies.

The purpose of this group is to provide mutual support for working on passion projects in the tech space.

Though our collective interests include open-source software, the projects this group works on will not be guaranteed to be open-source at first. The intention is that all projects will eventually be open-source, after each project has been properly prepared to be shared with the public.
